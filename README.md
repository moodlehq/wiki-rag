# Wiki-RAG

**Wiki-RAG (Mediawiki Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a project that leverages Mediawiki as a source for augmenting text generation tasks, enhancing the quality and relevance of generated content.

## Summary

Wiki-RAG integrates Mediawiki's structured knowledge (ingested via [API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)) with language models to improve text generation. By using retrieval-augmented generation and some interesting techniques, it provides more contextually relevant and accurate responses using any Mediawiki site as KB.

Labeled as an experimental project, Wiki-RAG is part of the [Moodle Research](https://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=17254) initiative, aiming to explore and develop innovative solutions for the educational technology sector.

## Requirements

To get started with Wiki-RAG, ensure you have the following:

- Git
- Python 3.12 or later with pip (Python package installer)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (if you intend to run the project using Docker)
- [Milvus 2.5.5](https://milvus.io/docs/release_notes.md#v255) or later (for vector similarity search). Standalone or Distributed deployments are supported. Lite deployments are not supported. It's highly recommended to use the [Docker Compose deployment](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker-compose.md) specially for testing and development purposes.

## Installation

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moodlehq/wiki-rag.git
   cd wiki-rag
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
   If interested into [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to the project, you can install the development dependencies by running:
   ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Using the [env_template](env_template) file as source, create a new `.env` file:
     ```bash
     cp env_template .env
     ```
   - Edit it to suit your needs (mediawiki site and namespaces or exclusions, models to use for both embeddings and generation, etc.)

5. **Run the Application**:
   The application comes with four different executables:
   - `wr-load`: Will parse all the configured pages in the source Mediawiki site, extracting contents and other important metadata. All the generated information will be stored into a JSON file in the `data` directory.
   - `wr-index`: In charge of creating the collection in the vector index (Milvus) with all the information extracted in the previous step.
   - `wr-search`: A tiny CLI utility to perform searches against the RAG system from the command line.
   - `wr-server`: A comprehensive and secure web service (documented with OpenAPI) that allows users to interact with the RAG system using the OpenAI API (`v1/models` and `v1/chat/completions` endpoints) as if it were a large language model (LLM).
