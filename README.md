# Wiki-RAG

**Wiki-RAG (Mediawiki Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a project that leverages Mediawiki as a source for augmenting text generation tasks, enhancing the quality and relevance of generated content.

## Summary

Wiki-RAG integrates Mediawiki's structured knowledge (ingested via [API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)) with language models to improve text generation. By using retrieval-augmented generation and some interesting techniques, it provides more contextually relevant and accurate responses using any Mediawiki site as KB.

Labeled as an experimental project, Wiki-RAG is part of the [Moodle Research](https://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=17254) initiative, aiming to explore and develop innovative solutions for the educational technology sector.

## Requirements

To get started with Wiki-RAG, ensure you have the following:

- Git
- Python 3.12 or later with pip (Python package installer)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (if you intend to run the project using Docker)
- [Milvus 2.5.5](https://milvus.io/docs/release_notes.md#v255) or later (for vector similarity search). Standalone or Distributed deployments are supported. Lite deployments are not supported. It's highly recommended to use the [Docker Compose deployment](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker-compose.md) specially for testing and development purposes.

## Configuration

1. **Set Environment Variables (to be replaced soon by `config.yml`file)**
   - Using the [env_template](env_template) file as source, create a new `.env` file:
     ```bash
     cp env_template .env
     ```
   - Edit it to suit your needs (mediawiki site and namespaces or exclusions, models to use for both embeddings and generation, etc.)

## Installation

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moodlehq/wiki-rag.git
   cd wiki-rag
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
   If interested into [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to the project, you can install the development dependencies and enable all the checks by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]  # To install all the development dependencies.
   pre-commit install     # To enable all the check (style, lint, commits, etc.)
   ```


4. **Run the Application**:
   The application comes with four different executables:
   - `wr-load`: Will parse all the configured pages in the source Mediawiki site, extracting contents and other important metadata. All the generated information will be stored into a JSON file in the `data` directory.
   - `wr-index`: In charge of creating the collection in the vector index (Milvus) with all the information extracted in the previous step.
   - `wr-search`: A tiny CLI utility to perform searches against the RAG system from the command line.
   - `wr-server`: A comprehensive and secure web service (documented with OpenAPI) that allows users to interact with the RAG system using the OpenAI API (`v1/models` and `v1/chat/completions` endpoints) as if it were a large language model (LLM).
   - `wr-mcp`: A complete and **UNPROTECTED** built-in MCP server that allows you to access to various parts of Wiki-RAG like prompts (system and use prompt with placeholders), resources (access to the source parsed documents) and tools (retrieve, optimise and generate) using the [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

### Running with Docker (Milvus elsewhere)

1. Pull the image from GitHub [Container Registry](https://github.com/moodlehq/wiki-rag/pkgs/container/wiki-rag):
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/moodlehq/wiki-rag:latest  # or specify a tag
   ```

2. Run the container:
   - **Note 1:** Don't forget to have the `.env` file in the same directory as the command below.
   - **Note 2:** The `data` directory will be created in the current directory, and it will store all the data generated by the `wr-load` command. If the `LOADER_DUMP_PATH` is set, you will have to change the volume mapping accordingly.
   ```bash
   docker run --rm --detach \
       --volume $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
       --volume $(pwd)/.env:/app/.env \
       --env MILVUS_URL=http://milvus-standalone:19530 \
       --network milvus \
       --publish 8080:8080 \
       --env OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY \
       --env LOG_LEVEL=info \
       --name wiki-rag \
       wiki-rag:latest
   ```
   - **Note 3:** The command above will start the `wr-server` automatically, listening on the configured port (8080) and the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required to interact with the embedding and LLM models. If, instead, you want to execute any of the other commands (`wr-load`, `wr-index`, `wr-search`), you can specify it as the last argument.
   - **Note 4:** The 2 lines related to Milvus are required to connect to the Milvus server **if also running in Docker**. If it's running elsewhere, you can replace the `MILVUS_URL` with the appropriate URL or configure it in the `.env` file instead
   - **Note 5:** You can use `docker logs wiki-rag` to check the logs of the running container (`wr-server` logs).
   - **Note 6:** When running the `wr-server`, you still can execute any of the commands (`wr-load`, `wr-index`, `wr-search`) using `docker exec -it wiki-rag <command>`.
   - **Note 7:** To stop and remove the container, you can use `docker stop wiki-rag`.

### Running with Docker Compose (all-in-one)

1. Download the Milvus Docker Compose file:
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/releases/download/v2.5.5/milvus-standalone-docker-compose.yml -O milvus-standalone.yml
   ```
   OR
   ```bash
   curl https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/releases/download/v2.5.5/milvus-standalone-docker-compose.yml -o milvus-standalone.yml
   ```

2. Run Wiki-RAG own Docker Compose file:
   - **Note 1:** Don't forget to have the `.env` file in the same directory as the command below.
   - **Note 2:** The `data` directory will be created in the current directory, and it will store all the data generated by the `wr-load` command. If the `LOADER_DUMP_PATH` is set, you will have to change the volume mapping accordingly.
   - **Note 3:** The `volumes` directory will be created in the current directory, ant it will store all the data required by the Milvus containers.
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   - **Note 4:** Some useful commands include:
     - To stop all the containers, you can use `docker compose stop`.
     - To start again all the containers, you can use `docker compose start`.
     - To stop and remove all the containers, you can use `docker compose down`.
   - **Note 5:** You can use `docker logs wiki-rag` to check the logs of the running container (`wr-server` logs).
    - **Note 6:** When running, you still can execute any of the commands (`wr-load`, `wr-index`, `wr-search`) using `docker exec -it wiki-rag <command>`.
